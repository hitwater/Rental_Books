Have an issue with an item? <br>
Here are our Store Policies.
We understand the hassles of purchasing an item, and finding out it was not the perfect one for you.<br>
Perhaps it was even damaged during shipment, or after delievery.<br>
Maybe it was defective upon arrival, and you need to exchange it for a new one.<br>
No problem. We got you covered in our policy below.<br>
<br>
<br>
We offer no returns on all merchandise and no exchanges either. No exceptions.<br>
